# golf_scorecard

A simple website that offers a UI mimicking a golf score card.

It should automatically compute scores as values are entered.

Via Google App Script you can write these scores onto a spreadsheet.

As of 2/22/2024, Alan stop trying to do the auto save function and reverted back to the
last 18 Feb 2024 version with the SAVE button.  So do not use the code past there.
